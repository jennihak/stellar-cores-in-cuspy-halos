# Stability of stellar cores in cuspy dark matter halos

This repository contains analysis and plotting code for the paper "Stellar cores live long and prosper in cuspy dark matter halos." Precomputed data for running the plotting script is provided as a `.zip` file. For the raw simulation data, or in the case of any other questions, please contact the corresponding author at jenni.hakkinen@helsinki.fi.

The code is written by Jenni Häkkinen and Alexander Rawlings, and it is published under the GNU General Public License v3.0.

## Repository structure
`evolution` contains scripts for analysing the evolution of the stellar system (stellar density, velocity anisotropy, and lagrangian radius)\
`fitting` contains scripts for Bayesian inference of the stellar density\
`plotting` contains scripts for plotting the figures in the paper\
`data.zip` contains the precomputed data computed with these scripts and used for the plotting
